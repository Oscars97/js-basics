//Let's create a tutorial, first we are going to declare some variables

var myNumber = 7; //This is a variable called myNumber with the value 7
var myString = "Hello"; //This is a variable called myString with the value "Hello"
var myBoolean = true; //this is a variable called my Boolean with the value true
var myArray = ["Oscar", "Carlos", "Maria"];
//if we want to check the type of the variable we should print: 
console.log(typeof myNumber);
console.log(typeof myString);
console.log(typeof myBoolean);
console.log(typeof myArray);

//with the function typeof we can check the type of the variable
