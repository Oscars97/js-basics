// Now we are going to work with array, but what is an array?
//An array is a data structure that can store values, object or even arrays.
//For example, we are going to create an array of fruits:
let fruits = ['apple', "pineapple", "grape", "orange", "melon", "watermelon"];

//if we want to know the size of the array we should write:
let size = fruits.length; //6

//now to get a specific item from this array we can code:
let apple = fruits[0] //apple

//if we want to print orange we have to write:
console.log(fruits[3])
